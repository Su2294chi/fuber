#fuber_cabs

This logic would be helpful to those, if implemnted for any cab service provider(Potential Users).
It says it would allow the customer to book the nearest cab depending on the customer's location. The choice could be of either booking a pink cab or any cab, by the customer for hipster reasons.. :)

Let's go ahead and quickly see the pre - requisites for this project..!!
Installation guide:-

Foremost thing we would need is an IDE(Integrated Development Environment). 
So... download this : https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
Can go for the IntelliJ Community(opensource) or IntelliJ Ultimate(Paid, trail free available). 
I would suggest.. Save your Bucks..!! :P

Secondly , we badly need to generate a quickstart spring boot java project. 
No issues, we have this https://start.spring.io/ to help us out further. SPRING INITIALIZR would provide an extensible API to genrate projects.

Well, all you have to do is: 
	1) Select the type of project. Options available are Maven / Gradle. I have choosen 	gradle in my project creation.
	2)Language options are Java/ Kotlin/ Groovy. I preferred java.
	3)Fill necessary details cooresponding to Artifact metadata and Dependencies 	( choosen Web).
	4) Done then..!! Kudos, go ahead and click on the "Generate Project"  ;)

End points : 
	1) assignCabToUser
	2) endTrip
